        "title": "Arto Salomaa Tribute",
        "content": "Mathematician and theoretical computer scientist Arto Salomaa passed away on January 26, 2025. He played a key role in the establishment and early development of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) , and served as its President from 1979 to 1985. The following is an excerpt from the preface to a Special Issue of Theoretical Computer Science (track C) published in Arto Salomaas honor. Arto Salomaa was a world-class Finnish mathematician and theoretical computer scientist, renowned for his foundational contributions to automata theory, formal languages, and numerous other areas within theoretical computer science. His work profoundly shaped the mathematical foundations of the field and inspired generations of researchers. His scientific career was truly international. As a graduate student, he received a scholarship to Berkeley, where he attended J. Myhills automata theory seminar, which deeply influenced him. Upon returning to his home institution, the University of Turku, he established a research group in automata theory that became internationally renowned and continues to be active today, more than half a century later. In the late 1960s, Arto spent three years at what became his second academic home, the University of Western Ontario in Canada. During this time, his first book, Theory of Automata , was published, marking the beginning of his extraordinary career as an author of scientific books. Shortly thereafter, he published his iconic monograph Formal Languages , a highly influential work that cemented his status as a pioneering figure in the field. Over the years, Arto authored more than ten highly influential scientific monographs. Some were masterful explorations of their respective topics, while others introduced or promoted novel areas of study, including formal power series, L-systems, public-key cryptography, and DNA computing. In collaboration with Grzegorz Rozenberg, Arto co-authored a comprehensive treatment of formal languages. This monumental work, the Handbook of Formal Languages , spans three volumes and over 2,000 pages, serving as a definitive reference in the field. Beyond being an exceptionally original and creative researcher who continually explored new directions, Arto was also a leading educator in theoretical computer science. The remarkable clarity of his mathematical writing introduced many scientists to formal languages and automata theory, and his texts became fundamental to the education of multiple generations of researchers. Also, many of the Ph.D. students he guided went on to become prominent scientists worldwide, further demonstrating his profound impact as an educator and mentor. Arto served three five-year terms as an Academy Professor of the Academy of Finland, the highest academic position in the country. In 2001, the Academy of Finland awarded him the title of Academician, a prestigious honor granted to only 12 individuals in the sciences nationwide. He was a highly decorated scientist, a testimony to his prestige within the international scientific community. Arto was the recipient of nine honorary degrees and a distinguished member of several esteemed institutions, including the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, the Finnish Society of Science and Letters, Academia Europaea, and the Hungarian Academy of Science as foreign member. His achievements were recognized with numerous prestigious awards, such asthe Prize of the Foundation for Finnish Culture, the Magnus Ehrnrooth Prize of the Finnish Society of Science and Letters, the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science Award, the Finnish Professor of the Year award, the Nokia Foundation Prize, and the title of Honorary Professor of the Al.I.Cuza University in Romania. In his honor, the Developments in Language Theory Symposium series has introduced the prestigious annual Arto Salomaa Prize. Arto made significant contributions to the scientific community. For instance, he played a key role in the establishment and early development of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, where he served as president from 1979 to 1985. Also, he was an active member of numerous editorial boards for prestigious academic journals and book series, further shaping the field through his expertise and leadership. We, the editors of the Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) journal Special Issue in his honor, express our deep sorrow at Artos passing. Each of us had the privilege of a warm and special friendship with him. We will miss him immensely and remain grateful for his presence in our lives and the profound influence he had on us. Heres to celebrating a remarkable life and the extraordinary scientific legacy that Arto leaves behind!

Industry Internship / Co-Op Career Opportunities Flexible Undergraduate Programs Along with the typical Honors Specialization, Majors, and Minors in Computer Science, we also offer several concurrent degree programs that can be completed in 1 year less than taking each degree separately. Currently, the concurrent degrees we offer are: Another of our very popular programs is Computer Science Honours Specialization with a Minor in Game Design. Or you might consider our newHonors Specialization in Data Sciences combining Computer Science, Data Sciences and Statistical Science. You could also combine two of your interests by pursuing a Major in Computer Science with a Minor in Psychology or Business. Or, of course, you can just get a pure degree in Computer Science. Click here for more information on our programs . The choice is yours! Opportunities to Collaborate With World-Renowned Faculty There are a variety of avenues for undergraduate students to pursue undergraduate research. This includes paid research assistantships and capstone courses in fourth year where you can receive academic credit for undergraduate research. Students are encouraged to talk to faculty on possible opportunities. Undergraduate research broadens students with opportunities to participate in ground breaking research and to enhance their understanding of Computer Science. Students are able to use the knowledge/skills from multiple courses. Students often work on interdisciplinary teams that may include members from other units on campus.Student research is often published and students with research experience of With Western Computer Science students can work with computational neuroscience faculty researchers and other students to understand how the brainlearnsandcomputes to achieveintelligent behavior. Bioinformatics faculty researchers on biology related problems.Network/systems researchers are developing new ways to write software to leverage the advantages of 5G. Computer vision researchers are working on autonomous vehicles.Researchers are leveraging artificial intelligence to advance medical sciences, neuroscience and games as well as developing interfaces to deal with an instrumented world as the result of IoT. Collaborative Work and Experiential Learning By second year, you will be working closely with your classmates and the professors on group and individual projects. Interdisciplinary options are also expanding, especially with the Medical Sciences. Experiential Learningfocusses on enhancing on learning through real world experience. This includes capstone projects, internships and research. Two examplesof these are the Open Source Software Project and the Master the Mainframe course. Most Beautiful Campus in Canada While we may be biased here, we've heard from many students after visiting usand seeing Western's campus that they just had to come here! In fact, in 2004, Western won the Communities in Bloom competition in the Parks and Grounds category, even beating out Banff National Park.

It meant staff spent time copying and pasting employment opportunities and formatting them to fit with the style of LEDCs central job board. As London saw rapid population growth, job postings were exploding. Haque knew he could create a better solution. It was a very laborous job. Im agine all these companies are posting jobs on a daily basis, and each has a different format. You only have a couple of people to convene all of them, digest them and post them on the LEDC website in a unified style; its impossible to do that in real time, Haque said. So, Haque, along with his PhD student Muhammad Zakar, built the answer using artificial intelligence (AI).
